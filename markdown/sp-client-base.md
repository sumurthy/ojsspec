## Classes

| Class	   |  Description |
|:-------------|:---------------|
| [`BasicHttpClient`](./sp-client-base/basichttpclient.md)     | BasicHttpClient implements a basic set of features for performing REST operations.  The subclass HttpClient extends this basic functionality with SharePoint-specific  enhancements. |
| [`Compare`](./sp-client-base/compare.md)     |  |
| [`CultureInfo`](./sp-client-base/cultureinfo.md)     | This class is primarily used with the PageContext class. It provides culture info  for the current user of the application. |
| [`Environment`](./sp-client-base/environment.md)     | This class contains contextual information about the enviroment that is hosting the framework and  its components. |
| [`Guid`](./sp-client-base/guid.md)     | This class represents a globally unique identifier,as described by  IETF RFC 4122. The input string is normalized and validated by the class  constructor, which provides important guarantees that simplify other code  that works with the GUID. This class also provides basic functionality  for generating a pseudo-random GUID ("version 4" UUID from the RFC);  however, be aware that the uniqueness depends on the browser's  Math.random() function and may be not be suitable for some applications.   |
| [`HttpClient`](./sp-client-base/httpclient.md)     | HttpClient is used to perform REST calls against SharePoint. It adds default  headers, manages the digest needed for writes, and collects telemetry that  helps the service to monitor the performance of an application.    For communicating with non-SharePoint services, use the BasicHttpClient  class instead. |
| [`Log`](./sp-client-base/log.md)     | The Log class provides methods for logging messages at different levels (verbose,  info, warning, error) and with context information. Context information helps identify  which component generated the messages and makes the messages useful and filterable.   |
| [`ODataBatch`](./sp-client-base/odatabatch.md)     | The ODataBatch class accumulates a number of REST service calls and  transmits them as a single ODATA batch. This protocol is documented here:  http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part1-protocol.html    The usage is to call ODataBatch.fetch() to queue each individual request,  and then call ODataBatch.execute() to execute the batch operation.  The execute() method returns a promise that resolves when the real REST  call has completed. Each call to fetch() also returns a promise that will  resolve with a Response object for that particular request.   |
| [`PageContext`](./sp-client-base/pagecontext.md)     | The page context provides standard definitions for common SharePoint objects  that need to be shared between the client-side application, web parts, and other  components. Typically the data is fetched via REST queries when navigating to a  new page, but it can also be preloaded by the web server, or filled from a custom  application cache. |
| [`ServiceKey`](./sp-client-base/servicekey.md)     | The ServiceKey is a lookup key that is used when calling ServiceScope.consume()  to fetch a dependency. The key also defines a default implementation of the  dependency, which will be autocreated by the root scope if the dependency is not found.  Providing a default implementation ensures that new dependencies can be safely  introduced without inadvertently breaking components that are loaded by an older host  (that does not provide the new dependency). |
| [`ServiceScope`](./sp-client-base/servicescope.md)     | ServiceScope provides a formalized way for components to register and consume dependencies  ("services"), and to enable different implementations to be registered in different scopes.  This improves modularity by decoupling components from their dependencies in an extensible way.    For example, suppose that various components need access to an IPageManager instance. We could  simply make the PageManager a singleton (i.e. global variable), but this will not work e.g. if  we need to create a pop-up dialog that requires a second PageManager instance. A better solution  would be to add the PageManager as a constructor parameter for each component that requires it,  however then we immediately face the problem that any code that calls these constructors  also needs a PageManager parameter. In an application with many such dependencies, business  logic that ties together many subsystems would eventually pick up a constructor parameter  for every possible dependency, which is unwieldy. A natural solution would be to move all the  dependencies into a class with name like "ApplicationContext", and then pass this around as our  constructor parameter. This enables the PageManager to be passed to classes that need it  without cluttering the intermediary classes that don't. However, it still has a design problem  that "ApplicationContext" has hard-coded dependencies on many unrelated things. A more flexible  approach is to make it a dictionary that can look up items for consumers/providers who know the  right lookup key (i.e. ServiceKey). This is the popular "service locator" design pattern,  familiar from the SPContext API in classic SharePoint.    ServiceScope takes this idea a step further in two important ways: First, it provides a scoping  mechanism so that e.g. if we had two different pages, they could each consume a unique PageManager  instance while still sharing other common dependencies. Secondly, it allows for a ServiceKey  to provide a default implementation of the dependency. This is important for API stability in  our modular client-side environment: For example, suppose that version 2.0 of our application  introduced a new IDiagnosticTracing interface that a version 2.0 component will expect to consume.  If the version 2.0 component gets loaded by an older 1.0 application, it would fail. We could  fix this by requiring each consumer to check for any missing dependencies and handle that case,  but it would require a lot of checks. A better solution is to ensure that a default implementation  always exists, perhaps just a trivial behavior, so that components don't have to worry about it.    Usage: ServiceScope instances are created by calling either ServiceScope.startNewRoot() or  ServiceScope.startNewChild(). They are initially in an "unfinished" state, during which provide()  can be called to register service keys, but consume() is forbidden. After ServiceScope.finish()  is called, consume() is allowed and provide() is now forbidden. These semantics ensure that  ServiceScope.consume() always returns the same result for the same key, and does not depend on  order of initialization. It also allows us to support circular dependencies without worrying  about infinite loops, even when working with external components that were implemented by  third parties. To avoid mistakes, it's best to always call consume() inside a callback from  serviceScope.whenFinished(). |
| [`SPPermission`](./sp-client-base/sppermission.md)     | This class can be used to determine if the current user has a requested set of permissions.  Specifies the built-in permissions available in SharePoint Foundation  Derived from OneDriveWeb/ODBNext/odsp-shared  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.spbasepermissions.aspx |
| [`SPSite`](./sp-client-base/spsite.md)     | This class is primarily used with the PageContext class. It provides contextual  information for the SharePoint site collection ("site") that hosts the page.   |
| [`SPUser`](./sp-client-base/spuser.md)     | This class is primarily used with the PageContext class. It provides contextual information  for the SharePoint user that is accessing the page.   |
| [`SPWeb`](./sp-client-base/spweb.md)     | This class is primarily used with the PageContext class. It provides contextual  information for the SharePoint site ("web") that hosts the page. |
| [`UrlQueryParameterCollection`](./sp-client-base/urlqueryparametercollection.md)     | Class for storing and retrieving query parameters.  The URL can be server-relative and it will parse empty/null strings.  The query parameters must start with? to indicate the first query parameter and  use & for all subsequent parameters. The class also supports fragments.  Edge cases behavior:  Empty value (www.example.com/?test=) stores key and empty value  No equals in queryParam (www.example.com/?test) stores key and undefined value  Empty queryParam (www.example.com/?&debug=on) stores undefined key and value  Query param with only equals (www.example.com/?=&debug=on stores empty string key and value |
| [`UrlUtilities`](./sp-client-base/urlutilities.md)     | Common helper functions for working with URLs. These utilities are intended to be simple,  small, and extremely common. Do not add advanced parsing logic to this file. |
| [`Validate`](./sp-client-base/validate.md)     | This class implements provides a standard way to validate properties and function parameters.  Unlike an assertion, the Validate checks are always performed and will always throw an error,  even in a production release. As such, be careful not to overuse these checks in a way  that might impact performance. |
