# Guid class





This class represents a globally unique identifier,as described by 
IETF RFC 4122. The input string is normalized and validated by the class 
constructor, which provides important guarantees that simplify other code 
that works with the GUID. This class also provides basic functionality 
for generating a pseudo-random GUID ("version 4" UUID from the RFC); 
however, be aware that the uniqueness depends on the browser's 
Math.random() function and may be not be suitable for some applications.

#### Signature
`equals(guid: Guid): boolean`

#### Returns
`boolean`
A value indicating whether this instance and the specified Guid object 
Compare this instance to another Guid instance 


#### Parameters

however, be aware that the uniqueness depends on the browser's 
Math.random() function and may be not be suitable for some applications. 


#### Signature
`isValid(guid: string): boolean`

#### Returns
`boolean`
Value indicating whether the guid is valid. 
Indicates whether a guid is valid (according to RFC4122). 


#### Parameters


| Parameter	   | Type    | Description |
|:-------------|:---------------|:------------|
| `guid`    | `string` | - Test guid |


### constructorGuid

This class represents a globally unique identifier,as described by 
IETF RFC 4122. The input string is normalized and validated by the class 
constructor, which provides important guarantees that simplify other code 
that works with the GUID. This class also provides basic functionality 
for generating a pseudo-random GUID ("version 4" UUID from the RFC); 
however, be aware that the uniqueness depends on the browser's 
Math.random() function and may be not be suitable for some applications. 


#### Signature
`newGuid(randomProvider?: IRandomProvider): Guid`

#### Returns
[`Guid`](../sp-client-base/guid.md)
A new valid unique Guid object 
Returns a new Guid instance with a pseudo-randomly generated Guid. 


#### Parameters


| Parameter	   | Type    | Description |
|:-------------|:---------------|:------------|
| `randomProvider`    | `IRandomProvider` | _Optional._ |


### toString

IETF RFC 4122. The input string is normalized and validated by the class 
constructor, which provides important guarantees that simplify other code 
that works with the GUID. This class also provides basic functionality 
for generating a pseudo-random GUID ("version 4" UUID from the RFC); 
however, be aware that the uniqueness depends on the browser's 
Math.random() function and may be not be suitable for some applications. 


#### Signature
`toString(): string`

#### Returns
`string`
The GUID value in lowercase hexadecimal without braces. 
Object.prototype.toString override 


#### Parameters
None


### tryParse

This class represents a globally unique identifier,as described by 
IETF RFC 4122. The input string is normalized and validated by the class 
constructor, which provides important guarantees that simplify other code 
that works with the GUID. This class also provides basic functionality

#### Signature
`tryParse(guid: string): Guid`

#### Returns
[`Guid`](../sp-client-base/guid.md)
If the guid argument was valid,a new Guid instance. Otherwise,undefined. 
Trys to construct a new Guid instance using guid string. The guid argument 
is normalized and validated. If the argument is not a valid "version 4" UUID from 
RFC 4122, tryParse will return undefined. 


#### Parameters


| Parameter	   | Type    | Description |
|:-------------|:---------------|:------------|
| `guid`    | `string` | - A guid string  Trys to construct a new Guid instance using guid string |
