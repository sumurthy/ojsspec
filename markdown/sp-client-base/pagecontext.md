# PageContext class





The page context provides standard definitions for common SharePoint objects 
that need to be shared between the client-side application, web parts, and other 
components. Typically the data is fetched via REST queries when navigating to a 
new page, but it can also be preloaded by the web server, or filled from a custom 
application cache.
