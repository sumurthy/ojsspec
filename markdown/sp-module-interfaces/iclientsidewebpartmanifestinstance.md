|`componentType`      | `'Application' `,` 'WebPart' `,` 'Library'` | Definition: Type of client side component. Components with the "Application" type are defined by the  "IClientSideApplicationManifest" interface. Components with the "WebPart" type are defined by the  "IClientSideWebPartManifest" interface.

|`description`      | [`ILocalizedString`](../sp-module-interfaces/ilocalizedstring.md) | Definition: Description of the web part represented as a dictionary of locale keys to description values. This  value will be displayed to the user in the toolbox. This description should be used in the Toolbox tooltip and  other display areas. The Web Part developer may give an initial description to the webpart. The organization admin  and page author will have the ability to change this description as per need.  Usage: display the description of the webpart in the toolbox tooltip, webpart gallery and the page.  Required: yes  Type: Object  Localized: yes  Supported values: a dictionary of locale keys to strings. Should always have a 'default' key.

|`group`      | [`ILocalizedString`](../sp-module-interfaces/ilocalizedstring.md) |  |
|`groupId`      | `string` |  |
|`iconImageUrl`      | `string` | Definition: The icon for the WebPart,to be displayed in the toolbox,represented an image URL. The image at the  URL must be exactly 38x38 px (SPPPLAT VSO#218660 to fix the size of the icon image).  If the '{@link officeFabricIconFontName}' field does not have a value, this field must have a value.  Required: no  Type: string  Localized: no  Supported values: Any absolute URL.  Example: "https://contoso.akamaihd.net/files/myWebpartIcon.png" |
|`id`      | `string` | Definition: A universally unique component id. Each client side component is required to have this id. Once an  id has been used for a component, it cannot be changed. A change in this value is treated same as the creation of  a new component. Two components are never expected to have the same id.  Usage: Uniquely identify a client side component.  Required: yes  Localized: no  Supported values: any GUID  Example: "dbef608d-3ad5-4f8f-b139-d916f2f0a294" |
|`imageLinkPropertyNames`      | `string[]` | Definition: List of names of Web Part properties that are image sources and need to be link fixed up  and potentially preloaded for performance reasons.  Required: no. If not provided, all values are sanitized  Type: string array  Supported values: any property names  Values: the strings in the array are expected to be JSONPath for the object properties.  (http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)  Example: ["image[0].source"] |
|`linkPropertyNames`      | `string[]` | Definition: List of names of Web Part properties that are links and need to be link fixed up.

|`loaderConfig`      | [`IClientSideComponentLoaderConfig`](../sp-module-interfaces/iclientsidecomponentloaderconfig.md) | Definition: This portion of the configuration describes how the component is to be loaded and initialized by a  client. It contains an enumeration of scripts that the component requires along with a single entrypoint script.  Usage: Loading a component.  Required: yes   |
|`manifestVersion`      | `number` | Definition: Version of the component manifest schema. The value of this field is controlled by Microsoft. The  purpose of this field is to help manage upgrades of the component manifest schema. A component developer needs to  only confirm that they are using the correct value per the manifest schema. Please read the "manifest upgrade  rules" for more details on when the schema could change. Note, manifest schema version upgrade will be considered  a big API change event and will be advertised broadly.  Usage: To help support multiple manifest schema versions.  Required: yes  Localized: no  Supported values: +ve integer.  Example: 1 |
|`officeFabricIconFontName`      | `string` | Definition: The icon for the Web Part,to be displayed in the toolbox,represented as a character name in the  Office 365 icon font file.

Required: no  Type: string  Localized: no  Supported values: Any character name in the Office 365 Icon Font.  Example: "graph" |
|`properties`      | `TProperties` | Definition: every Web Part is expected to have some custom properties. e.g. an image Web Part may have the image  url and caption text as custom properties, a list Web Part may have the list id and list title as custom  properties, and so on. The Web Part framework is transparent to these properties. It just acts as a conduit to  pass these properties in and out to the Web Parts. The Web Part developer fully controls the schema of these  properties. The Web Part developer should follow versioning rules (@todo: pointer to Web Part versioning document)  to evolve these properties.    Usage: rendering of the Web Part.  Required: yes  Localized: no  Supported values: any  Example: {"imageSource": "https://contoso.akamaihd.net/files/contosoLogo.jpg", "captionText": "Contoso logo"}" |
|`searchablePropertyNames`      | `string[]` | Definition: List of names of Web Part properties that need to be indexed for search.  Usage: extract the specified value properties on the server and provide them to the search indexer.  Required: no. If not provided, no values are indexed.  Type: string array  Values: the strings in the array are expected to be JSONPath for the object properties.  (http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)  Supported values: any property names  Example: ["text"] |
|`title`      | [`ILocalizedString`](../sp-module-interfaces/ilocalizedstring.md) | Definition: Title of the web part represented as a single a dictionary of locale keys to title values. This  value will be displayed to the user in the toolbox. This title should be used in the Toolbox and other display  areas. The Web Part developer may give an initial title to the webpart.

Required: yes  Type: Object  Localized: yes  Supported values: a dictionary of locale keys to strings. Should always have a 'default' key.

|`version`      | `string` | Definition: Client side component version. The value of this field is expected to be controlled by the developer  of the client side component. The purpose of this field is to help client side component developers upgrade their  client side components in a managed way. This helps the consumers of the client side component make decisions  about when and how to upgrade the client side component. As the developer evolves the code for their client side  component, they can decide to bump the MAJOR, MINOR or PATCH version of the component. All incompatible API  changes should result in a MAJOR version bump. Backwards compatible functionality changes should result in a  MINOR version bump, and backwards compatible bug fixes should result in a PATCH version bump. Please see  http://semver.org for more details on how to manage the version of your components.  Usage: Versioning and evolving a client side component safely in a controlled way.  Required: yes  Localized: no  Supported values: string representing a semantic version (http://semver.org) i.e. MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH  Example: "1.0.0" |
